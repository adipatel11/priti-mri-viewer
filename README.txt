README
======

  The Medstrat Joints system is intended to enable the communication, storage, viewing and manipulation of diagnostic medical images and data. Users of the read-only CDs generated by the Joints can be untrained (patients) or trained professionals (orthopedic surgeons, referring and collaborating physicians, authorized medical professionals).

View Read-only Images 
=====================

  The CD contains a page link (view-studies.html) that will display read-only, compressed images in the computer's default Web browser. 
  
  To open this page you need to double-click on the "view-studies.html" file or right-click on the "view-studies.html" file and select the "Open" option.

  The page opened in the default Web browser will allow viewing of the compressed images stored on the CD.

DICOM Files
===========

  The CD contains a directory labeled "DICOM" that will contain the diagnostic quality DICOM files. These files are copies of originals stored by Medstrat and are for the use of the end user. DICOM files may, or may not, contain a .dcm extension. Users will need access to a DICOM viewer in order to use or view DICOM files.

Help
====

  If further assistance is required please contact the medical professional office that supplied the CD.
